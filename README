This is a pretty simple extension for Magento which enables single sign-on authentication between Magento Customers and Uservoice support site.

Based upon the original Uservoice documentation (you can find it here: http://developer.uservoice.com/docs/single-sign-on-how-to/) this Magento extension allow you:

* configure basic settings (enable/disable, subdomain, SSO key, Javascript ID
* automatically place user voice widget on commerce site (you can configure it on Uservoice admin page)
* add ability to login both on ecommerce site and Uservoice with same account
* add ability to automatically login on Uservoice when customer is already logged in on ecommerce site

You should customize the file "app/design/frontend/default/default/template/page/1column-uservoice.phtml" this is the page called on the Uservoice popup when you are nbot logged in and you request to login.
